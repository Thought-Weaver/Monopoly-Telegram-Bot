Each player rolls the dice to see who goes first. The person who rolls the largest number goes first. Everyone starts on the space that says, "Go".

Whenever you land on a land that no one owns, you can buy it from the bank. If you do not want to buy it the Banker sells it at an auction. (Not everyone plays by the auction rule). All of the prices for the land are on the board. Once you own the land, players must pay a rent if they are waiting on your land.

If you land on a Chance or a Community Chest card, you must do what it says. For example, "Go to Jail, Directly to Jail", "Advance to Go".

If you roll doubles (the same number on both dice) you get to roll again.

When you pass "Go", you collect $200 from the bank. (Unless you have to go to jail).

"Free Parking" is an area that is free to be in. If you land in the area you do not have to worry about paying for anything.

There are two ways to get into jail: (1) You land on the space labeled "Go to Jail" or (2) You pick a Chance or Community Chest card that says "Go to Jail". There are three ways to get out of jail: (1) You get three turns to roll a double, if you do not roll a double in the three turns you must pay the $50 fine, (2) using a "Get out of Jail Free" card (that can be found in Chance or Community Chest), or (3) pay a fine of $50.

Once you own all of one color, you can start to build houses. Houses make the land more costly and every time you add a house the price goes up more. Once there are four houses on each land you can get a hotel (there can only be one hotel on any land).

You can trade properties, "Get Out of Jail Free" cards, and money with other players on your turn.

If you are bankrupt, you cannot pay someone rent or cannot pay a tax. If you declare bankruptcy you are done with the game.
